Make sure your system has the following files:

~/.aws/credentials

aws_secret_access_key=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
aws_session_token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN  # (optional for long-lived keys)
~/.aws/config

region=us-east-1
output=json
Secure your credential files:

chmod 600 ~/.aws/credentials
chmod 600 ~/.aws/config
 2. Clone the Repository
bash

git clone https://github.com/avisheshjha1105/pgbadger-reporter.git
cd pgbadger-reporter
 3. Build the Docker Image

docker build -t pgbadger-reporter .
4. Run the Docker Container
bash

docker run --rm \
  -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws \
  -e AWS_PROFILE=default \
  pgbadger-reporter your-s3-bucket-name 1
